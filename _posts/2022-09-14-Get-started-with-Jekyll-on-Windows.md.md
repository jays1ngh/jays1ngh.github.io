## Why this is documented
Well! I am installing Jekyll locally on my freshly built Windows OS, it is a great opportunity for me to document the steps.

## Prerequisites
Checkout the official [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) website and prerequisites should be listed on top of the [docs page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).
1. Ruby version 2.5.0 or higher (at the time of writing this blog)
2. RubyGems
3. GCC and Make

### Ruby version 2.5.0 or higher
Alright, let's go and download Ruby for Windows. Go to [RubyInstaller website](https://rubyinstaller.org/) and hit the big red *Download* button. This will take you to the next page where you select the installer. Go with the *WITH DEVKIT* as this will have the most compatible Gems. I downloaded the top in the list from *WITH DEVKIT*, version 3.1.2-1(64). Keep everything default checked and leave MSYS2 checked as well.
